# pit

## WIP: This is very much still a work in progress, it will probably break.

`pit` is a smartish wrapper around `go test`. It's end goal will be to only run tests for those
files/packages that have changed, and the packages that depend on the changed files/packages.

`pit` was just easy to type, but the current working backronym for `pit` is _**p**rivate **i**nvestigator for **t**ests_
